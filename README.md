C++ is a general-purpose programming language known for its high performance, efficiency, and flexibility. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. 
C++ allows developers to work closely with hardware and manage system resources directly, while also 
providing powerful abstractions for building complex software.

Common uses of C++ include:
- Game development
- Operating systems
- Embedded systems
- High-performance applications such as simulations and financial systems
